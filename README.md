<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://anime-x-echosonusharma.vercel.app)

This project was something that I had in my mind for quite a long, even before I was into web development. I have been watching anime from middle school and after literally watching hundreds of them over the years, it was really hard to keep track of what anime I've watched and what I'd like to save to watch in the the future and all that. I did found some solutions to that but either they were too clunky or slow or just were bad in general. So, now that I am capable of utilizing such powerful tools like react and express to my will, I decided to start this project.

The project is in build process, so it does have issues, code that's frequently being refactored,
some repetition, hopefully it will be more refined in the future.

Features :star2: :

- Get all details about a anime with characters, episodes, stats, recommendation and reviews.

- Search by genre.

- Categorize your favorite anime the way you like (:construction: in work).

Current issues :warning: :

- Database issues in the backend with serializing user using oAuth :boom:

- Unregulated image size :expressionless:
